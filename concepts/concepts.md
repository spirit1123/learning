# Concepts
The student defines the speed at which the course progresses. Everybody can learn any topic just as they desire to.
There shall never be prerequisits to anything, if some knowledge needs to be aquired to understand something else, there should be a reference to it, but never a: 'you need to complete this before you allowed to progress'.
