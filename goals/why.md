# Why this project?
Education and knowledge should be accessable to anybody.
Since knowledge and the ability to participate is essential to take part in our modern society, it seems obvious that there shouldn't be restricted access to education.
The porpuse of this project is to grant everybody access to education.

## Basic principels
- Accounts are strictly optional
    - having an account adds comparision to the equation, which also generates competition
        - that'll destroy safety and freedom to learn, try, fail, try again and finaly succed
    - noone should need an account to learn, in this case progress will be saved to the local storage
    - if the user owns an account, progress will also be saved to the server
        - accounts only store progress, but nothing else, therefor noone could share and compare each other
- No paywalls
    - education should allways remain free for all

## Gates
The road towards an educated human being is long and one has to pass multiple gates on the way.
The first gate one has to pass is the ability to read and write. Therefor the first step will be to enable anyone to lern to read and write.

### Gate 0 - Accessability
Since education is for everybody there should be accessability for anyone. This is why this project needs to be accessable for all kinds of handicaped persons. The interface therefor needs to be usable by people without sight or the ability to hear.
So all videos and audio files are required to have a transcription, every text needs to be available as audio.
The UX needs to have a keybound experience, and the whole UI/UX should adapt to the system settings - for example if a computer is configured to support blind users, the UX UI should automaticly swtich to the correct setting.

### Gate 1 - Read & Write

### Gate 2
